**Proposed Level of Achievement:** Project Gemini

Studentsavers bot is a telegram bot which helps NUS students to keep track of their weekly deliverables and also search for 
room availability in the school premises.

**Motivation** 
<br /> <br />
Many students in NUS struggle staying organized and often lose track of assessment's deadlines. Thus, Studentsavers bot can 
help to address this concern by **reminding them the due dates**.   
Instead of search each room physically by walking around different blocks in school, Studentsavers bot can automatically **do 
the searching of room availability** for the students.

**User stories**
<br /> 
1. As a student who does not check Luminus announcements frequently, Studentsavers bot can help to pull out important dates/
deadlines and add it to my Google calendar.
2. As a student who often loses track of my study process, it is rather efficient to have Studentsavers bot to send me a 
reminder message to allow me to be more mindful of assessment and assignment submission dates to prevent missing deadlines.
3. As a student who always spends time studying in between lessons, it is tedious to find an available room by walking 
around and searching each room physically.    
4. As a teaching assistant or professor, I would like to be able to check the schedule of the tutorial room I am using 
so that I do not extend/overshoot my lesson and inconvenience the next group of users for the room.
